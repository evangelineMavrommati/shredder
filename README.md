## WIP - Discord bot that integrates w Warcraft Logs

**Under Construction**
_Need to sort out  environment: 1)  do I want  to use discord.js  (it has hard node dependency)  2) how to  organize Warcraft Log integration and Discord bot code_

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.30. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
